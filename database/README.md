# Database Files Moved

**Note:** The database files have been moved to `src/database/` for deployment purposes.

All operational files now reside in the `src/` directory, which is the only directory deployed to the web server.

## New Location

- Schema: `src/database/schema.sql`
- Web setup interface: `src/setup/index.php`

## Usage

Browse to your MOSAIC installation and you'll be automatically redirected to the web-based setup interface.

See `src/setup/README.md` for complete setup documentation.
