## Drop-in Installation

MOSAIC is designed as a drop-in install where the `src/` directory is the web root. Point your web server document root at `src/` and you're ready to go.

**Security Requirements:**

Since `src/` is web-accessible, protect sensitive directories:

1. **config/** - Database credentials, API keys
   - Add `.htaccess` with `Deny from all` (Apache)
   - Add `index.php` that exits immediately (fallback)
   - Never commit `config.yaml` to version control

2. **logs/** - Stored at project root, outside web root

3. **uploads/** (if implemented) - User-uploaded files
   - Add `.htaccess` with appropriate restrictions
   - Serve files through PHP script with authentication checks

**Example .htaccess for src/config/:**
```apache
Deny from all
```

## Code Organization

### Page-Based Structure
- Direct mapping: URL → file → response
- Pages organized by feature area (`dashboard/`, `lti/`, etc.)
- Optional Models for shared data access patterns
- Common includes for consistent framework asset loading
- See [CODE_ORGANIZATION.md](CODE_ORGANIZATION.md)

### Database Layer
- MySQL 8.0+ database
- Assessment data storage
- LTI consumer management
- Direct queries with prepared statements
- See [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md)

## Assessment Hierarchy

```
Institution
    └── Institutional Outcomes
        └── Program Outcomes
            └── Programs

SLO Sets (per year/quarter/period)
    ├── Terms
    │   └── Course Sections (with CRN)
    │       └── Enrollments
    │           └── Assessments
    └── Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
        └── Mapped to Program Outcomes
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **SLO Sets**: SLOs are grouped by time period (academic year, quarter, semester, etc.)
- **Terms**: Each academic term is linked to an SLO Set, determining which SLOs are assessed
- **CRN**: Each course section has a unique Course Reference Number for registration and LTI integration
- **Enrollments**: Students enroll in course sections (which have CRNs)
- **Assessments**: Tied to enrollment records for specific SLOs from the term's SLO Set

## Key Features

1. **Multi-level Assessment Tracking**
   - Institutional outcomes
   - Program outcomes
   - Student learning outcomes
   - Individual student assessments

2. **Organizational Structure**
   - Departments
   - Programs
   - Courses
   - Course sections (by term)

3. **User Management**
   - Role-based access control
   - Context-aware permissions
   - Audit trail tracking

4. **LTI Integration**
   - LTI 1.1/1.3 support
   - Consumer key management
   - Secure launch validation

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: PHP 8.1+ (required)
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+ (required, InnoDB engine, UTF8MB4 charset)
  - No database abstraction layer - direct MySQL implementation
  - For alternative storage needs, use data connector plugins
- **Web Server**: Apache, Nginx, or any PHP 8.1+ compatible server
- **Frontend**: 
  - AdminLTE 4.0 (admin dashboard framework)
  - Bootstrap 5.3.2 (CSS framework, included with AdminLTE)
  - jQuery 3.7.0 (optional, for custom scripting)
  - Font Awesome 6.4.0 (icons)
  - All frameworks loaded via CDN from `src/system/includes/header.php`

## Security Features

- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- SQL injection prevention (prepared statements)
- XSS protection (output escaping)
- CSRF protection
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
