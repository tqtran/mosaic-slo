## Vision

Replace fragmented, manual assessment processes with an integrated, automated system that:
- Reduces faculty administrative burden by 85%
- Provides real-time visibility into learning outcomes across the institution
- Generates accreditation-ready reports with minimal effort
- Integrates directly into existing teaching workflows

## Core Promises

### 🔌 Seamless LMS Integration
- **LTI 1.1/1.3 Compliant:** Connect with Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, and other LMS platforms
- **Zero Manual Entry:** Faculty submit assessments directly from their LMS with one-click launches
- **Auto-Provisioning:** Students and course data flow automatically from the LMS

### 📊 Real-Time Analytics & Reporting
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Filter and analyze outcomes by course, discipline, program, and term
- **Powerful Visualizations:** Track trends and patterns across the institution
- **Drill-Down Capabilities:** Move from institution-wide metrics to individual course sections
- **Term-Over-Term Comparisons:** Identify improvement areas and successful interventions

### 🎓 Accreditation Support
- **Standards-Aligned Reports:** Generate comprehensive accreditation reports in minutes, not weeks
- **Evidence Documentation:** Track assessment methods and store evidence artifacts
- **Alignment Mapping:** Visualize connections between course SLOs, program outcomes, and institutional outcomes
- **Audit Trail:** Complete history of assessments and modifications

### 👥 Faculty-Friendly Experience
- **Intuitive Interface:** Simple, purpose-built tools that respect faculty time
- **Bulk Operations:** Enter multiple student assessments at once
- **Flexible Assessment:** Optional numeric scoring or simple proficiency indicators
- **Minimal Training:** Instructors can start using the system immediately

### 🏛️ Institutional Hierarchy
- **Complete Assessment Chain:** Institution → Programs → Courses → Students
- **Flexible Structure:** Support multiple departments, programs, and outcome frameworks
- **Role-Based Access:** Appropriate views for administrators, coordinators, and faculty
- **FERPA Compliant:** Secure handling of student assessment data

## Technology Approach

- **Modern PHP Stack:** PHP 8.1+ with MySQL 8.0+
- **Standards-Based:** LTI 1.1/1.3, OAuth, SAML 2.0
- **Plugin Architecture:** Extensible for institution-specific needs
- **AdminLTE 4 UI:** Responsive, accessible admin dashboard framework
- **Security-First:** FERPA-compliant data handling, prepared statements, CSRF protection

---

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Early development with comprehensive design documentation and working prototypes.

- ✅ Complete design specifications in `design_concepts/`
- [OK] Working demo implementations in `mosaic-slo/demo/` using AdminLTE 4
- 🚧 Core MVC architecture implementation in progress
- 📋 Authentication systems (local, LTI, SAML) planned
- 📋 Plugin system specification complete

---

## Design Philosophy

**Simplicity Over Flexibility**

We prioritize usability and pragmatic solutions over theoretical flexibility:

- [OK] **Opinionated Choices:** MySQL-only, PHP 8.1+, AdminLTE 4 (no alternatives)
- ✅ **Clear Requirements:** Hard technical requirements prevent compatibility chaos
- ✅ **Concrete Implementation:** Ship working features, not abstract frameworks
- ✅ **Strategic Flexibility:** Plugin system for real institutional differences
- ❌ **No Premature Abstraction:** Build what's needed now, not what might be needed later

**User-Centered Design**

- Faculty time is precious—minimize clicks and cognitive load
- Administrators need visibility—provide powerful analytics without complexity
- Students are stakeholders—protect their data and privacy rigorously
- Institutions vary—support customization through plugins, not core code modification

## Contributing

This project is in early development. Contributions should align with design specifications in `design_concepts/`. Before implementing features:

1. **Read relevant design docs** - All implementations must follow specifications
2. **Start with demos** - Prototype in `mosaic-slo/demo/` first
3. **Follow conventions** - Naming, security patterns, and MVC structure
4. **Keep it simple** - Resist overengineering and premature abstraction
