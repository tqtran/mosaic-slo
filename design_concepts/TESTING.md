# Testing Strategy

## Testing Philosophy

Comprehensive testing ensuring quality, security, and reliability of assessment data.

## Test Pyramid

```
        /\
       /  \      E2E Tests (Few)
      /────\     
     /      \    Integration Tests (Some)
    /────────\   
   /          \  Unit Tests (Many)
  /────────────\ 
```

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

**What to Test:**
- Model methods (CRUD operations)
- Validation logic
- Business rules
- Helper functions
- Calculations

**Approach:**
- Isolate dependencies
- Mock database
- Test edge cases
- Test error conditions

**Target Coverage:** 80%+ on models

### 2. Integration Testing

**What to Test:**
- Controller + Model interactions
- Database queries with real DB
- Authentication flows
- Authorization checks
- Form submissions

**Approach:**
- Test database for each test
- Seed test data
- Clean up after tests
- Test happy paths and errors

### 3. Security Testing

**What to Test:**
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attacks
- CSRF protection
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization violations
- Session hijacking

**Approach:**
- Automated security scanners
- Manual penetration testing
- Input fuzzing
- Known attack patterns

### 4. Accessibility Testing

**What to Test:**
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast
- Semantic HTML

**Approach:**
- Automated tools (axe, WAVE)
- Manual keyboard testing
- Screen reader testing
- User testing with disabilities

### 5. Performance Testing

**What to Test:**
- Page load times
- Assessment grid rendering
- Report generation
- Database query performance
- Concurrent user load

**Metrics:**
- Page load < 2 seconds
- API response < 100ms
- Support 100 concurrent users

### 6. End-to-End Testing

**Critical Workflows:**
- Complete authentication flows
- Create course → Add SLOs → Assess students
- Generate and export reports
- LTI launch from LMS
- SAML SSO login

**Approach:**
- Automated browser testing
- Test in production-like environment
- Include all authentication methods

## Test Environment

**Requirements:**
- Separate test database
- Test data fixtures
- Mock external services (LMS, IdP)
- Consistent test state

**Setup:**
- Automated environment setup
- Database migrations run automatically
- Seed data loaded
- Cleanup after test suite

## Continuous Integration

**On Each Commit:**
- Run unit tests
- Run integration tests
- Security scan
- Accessibility audit
- Code quality check

**Before Deployment:**
- Full test suite passes
- No critical vulnerabilities
- Accessibility compliance verified
- Performance benchmarks met

## Test Data

**Strategy:**
- Realistic but synthetic data
- No real student information
- Consistent test fixtures
- Edge cases included
- Large datasets for performance testing

## Success Criteria

**Release Requirements:**
- [ ] 100% critical path tests passing
- [ ] 80%+ code coverage on models
- [ ] Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Zero XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- [ ] All authentication flows tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan passed

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Authentication

- [ ] Dashboard login
- [ ] LTI 1.1 launch
- [ ] LTI 1.3 launch
- [ ] SAML SSO login
- [ ] Session timeout
- [ ] Logout

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Create/edit outcomes
- [ ] Create/edit courses
- [ ] Add students
- [ ] Assess students (grid)
- [ ] Generate reports
- [ ] Export data

### Authorization

- [ ] System admin access
- [ ] Faculty access to own courses only
- [ ] Student access to own results only
- [ ] Prevent unauthorized access

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Large class sizes (100+ students)
- [ ] Multiple SLOs per course (10+)
- [ ] Empty states (no data)
- [ ] Invalid input handling
- [ ] Network errors
